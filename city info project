Tourism industry is a booming industry that enriches knowledge, brings social
development and economic growth also. Service industries are of recent development in
India compared to developed nations. Nowadays, tourism and medical tourism are fast
growing areas. But, there are lots of problems faced by tourists during their tour due to
poor facilities, uncertainties, cleanliness, safety, etc. Dailies bring out reports on such
issues. Previously, people used to tour mainly on pilgrimage. But now, the culture has
changed. In our country also, many people plan for their tour as a regular affair may be

once in a year. In this growing field, it is highly important to study the major issues faced
by tourists and to take necessary steps to reduce such problems.

in order to solve this problem  we have decided to make a software which will have information 
about the places of that city like places for tourists,places of food zone,hospitality,markets ,malls ,hospitals etc.
the name of our software is the city info
